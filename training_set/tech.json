We will discuss hardware, software, datacenter, storage, operations, and software rollout as we consider what happens when stuff is constantly breaking and you are too big to NOT fail.\"\n\nAfterward, you\u2019ll get the chance to hear from a panel of former Salesforce tech interns to discuss their experience working at one of Fortune's Best Companies to Work For\" and answer all of your questions about the kind of impactful internship experiences that could be in your future with Salesforce!

With that in mind, Root set out to reinvent a broken industry \u2014 an industry that was still assigning rates based primarily on demographics and had an archaic agent structure.\n\nRoot's core data science challenge is understanding driving behavior from smartphone sensor data. We have logged billions of miles and our datasets are growing at an exponential rate. Computational and statistical challenges abound.\n\nWe believe a large part of the insurance challenge can be solved with a principled quantitative framework, and we are committed to developing and deploying methods that draw upon modern tools from the statistical machine learning community. In addition to telematics risk-scoring, the data science team works on core problems in pricing, reserving, marketing, and elasticity modeling. The team applies rigorous data-driven methods to making decisions across the entire business.\n\nCome and meet Matt Bonakdarpour (SCS 2009), our VP of Data Science, to hear how Root is using data to shape the future of car insurance.",

If we want technology that can successfully anticipate the needs of a diverse set of users, the people who build those products must also be diverse. Code is not the only path to contribution, and tech startups need more than just computer science majors. How do you build the diverse team you need, whether you are a small startup or a Fortune 100 company?

At Aetna, a CVS Company, we are using data science on primarily claims data to develop new products and innovative services to positively reshape chronic disease management. Our transformative models and cutting edge analytics have national outcomes that are benefiting the health of countless Americans.\n\nFor example, CVS\u2019s new home dialysis program was incepted on our team and validated with analytics on Aetna\u2019s claims data. This project is designed to delay the onset of end state renal disease, reduce hospitalizations, eliminate unnecessary emergency room visits, and lower patient healthcare costs. It\u2019s working. We currently have patients on home dialysis due to our work.\n\nMany more projects are in development. Some of the chronic conditions that we are currently working to mitigate are chronic kidney disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n\nWe are differentiated from other teams in CVS because we use claims data to underpin our modeling and analytics. The petabytes of data we leverage allow our neural nets, random forests, shap force plots, regressions, and other models to be more predictive and more externally valid than the models of our peers. Coupled with CVS\u2019s national footprint our individualized models are fundamentally improving treatment outcomes and creating new ways to access healthcare. We are obsessed with making our members healthier.\nWe have a great team. Our data scientists are unparalleled. Our data engineers move mountains to productionalize models and incorporate nettlesome internet of things third-party data. We collaborate with our support team of nephrologists, endocrinologists, cardiologists, physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and more to ground our data science in the latest medical findings.\nWhy should you come to work at Aetna? CVS Health\u2019s enterprise assets empower our team to make a health impact on the caliber of the federal government (and we move much faster). Our claims records combined with CVS\u2019s data enables us to solve previously unanswerable questions; we have access to everything from candy bars purchases to electronic medical records. We have unrivaled data. Finally, we have a passionate team who is laser focused on making people healthier. We are changing how American\u2019s manage their chronic diseases.\n\nIf you have the data scientist tool kit, coupled with either a passion for healthcare or the business expertise to execute cutting edge innovations, you want to be on our team.\n\nData Scientist and Senior Data Scientist roles are based out of New York City-NY, Hartford -CT, and Wellesley-MA. All roles are on the Consumer Health and Services - Analytics and Behavior Change - Advanced Product team of Aetna, a CVS Company.",
