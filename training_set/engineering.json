Come learn about the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), why it\u2019s a great place to work, and how you may be a fit! A Recruiter, and a Hiring Manager will be on hand to discuss these items and answer your questions. Bring your resumes as we will discuss NGA's mission and the various full-time positions and internships that NGA offers.\n\nNGA is providing full-time and internship opportunities to students from a range of majors, including Environmental Studies, History, Global Studies, Linguistics, Anthropology, Political Science, Economics, Geography, GIS, Geophysics, Biochemistry, Math, Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, Computer Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, History, Global Studies, Linguistics, Anthropology, Political Science, Economics or related disciplines. The list above is just an example of majors NGA interns have had in the past. If you do not have any of the majors above, don't fret! There are opportunities at NGA for all majors.\n\nNGA is looking for students of all years, and are particularly interested in freshmen. Unlike many firms, we will take students very early in their college career for internships (as early as the summer after their freshman year) and each subsequent summer too if the opportunity is of interest to the student.\n\nNGA is a unique combination of an intelligence agency and combat support agency. NGA delivers world-class geospatial-intelligence that provides a decisive advantage to policymakers, warfighters, intelligence professionals and first responders",
