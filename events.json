On average it takes all parties involved approximately 7-14 days to review an EULA and ensure that all unacceptable terms and conditions are identified.\n\nA EULA details the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of software or services. It can also be known as a software license agreement or acceptable use policy. As part of the acquisition process of software or services, GSA reviews the associated EULAs. This review must be completed prior to awarding new contracts or modifying existing contracts. A GSA contracting officer (CO) reviews applicable EULAs for terms and conditions that are not in accordance with Federal law and regulations. The CO may also coordinate a legal review with the Office of General Counsel if they feel it is warranted. Should EULAs contain language that would conflict with Federal law and regulations, the CO must negotiate changes to the EULA to remove the problematic language.\n\nWe are looking for a solution that will use AI and/or ML to improve this manual process. The solution will include a user interface that GSA will use to process the documents and identify unacceptable clauses/terms in the EULAs. Watch our AI / ML challenge video to learn more about the desired solution.\n\nThis solution will decrease the time spent manually reviewing EULAs and free resources to focus on other aspects of the acquisition process. It will also improve the accuracy and consistency of the review process.\n\n\nYoutube video announcing GSA ML/AI Challenge - https://youtu.be/uOBFIqoOJ8k\n\nWebsite with complete details - https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/GSA-artificial-intelligence-AI-machine-learning-ML-challenge/\n\nKey Facts:\n\u00b7      Registration begins: 10 a.m. ET, July 6, 2020\n\u00b7      Submit solutions before: 5 p.m. ET, August 20, 2020\n\u00b7      Semi-finalists announced: 10 a.m. ET, September 4, 2020\n\u00b7      Winner announced: 10 a.m. ET, September 11, 2020\n\u00b7      Each challenge solver (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register by sending an email to challenge2020@gsa.gov with the subject line stating \u2018Challenge 2020 Registration\u2019.\n\n\u00b7      Cash prizes for winning teams:\no  1st place team: $15,000.00\no  2nd place team: $2,500.00\no  3rd place team: $2,500.00\n\n\u00b7      Questions? emailchallenge2020@gsa.gov for more information.",
