The Carnegie Mellon University Alumni Virtual Career Fairis an opportunity to connect with employers who are hiring for all roles.  This is the first time we have held a virtual career fair for the CMU Alumni population so you will not want to miss out!Ifyouareacurrentstudentyoumayattendthisfairifyouaregraduatingin May/August2020.\nTo register for this event please visit: https://app.brazenconnect.com/a/cmu_career/e/48R1M\nThe CMU Alumni Virtual Career Fair occurs on May 28 from 1:00pm - 3:00pm EDT.  Please note the following reminders and instructions for the event. We will be using the platform Brazen for the virtual fair. https://app.brazenconnect.com/a/cmu_career/e/48R1M\n1) Before the event starts, log-in to Brazen to update your registration page if you haven\u2019t already (top-right corner under your name). This registration page will allow you to add a resume and other key information for employers to view. To participate, you can log in with the same link to begin. https://app.brazenconnect.com/a/cmu_career/e/48R1M\n2) Chats with employers have been set to 12 minutes. This time goes quickly, so I recommend brainstorming a few main takeaways that you would hope to capture/share before the time expires (i.e., contact information, job titles, next-step instructions, etc.) These are text-based chats \u2013 not video chats.\n4) Click hereand scroll down to watch a video on what to expect."
