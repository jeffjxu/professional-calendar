    "description": "Heinz College Public Service Fair\nThe Public Service Fair is an opportunity for Heinz students to find local non-profit and government organizations to find remote intern, work study, or volunteer positions during the fall and spring semesters. Many organizations in attendance hire through the paid Federal Community Service Work Study program. Others provide excellent volunteer opportunities. This is a great opportunity to find meaningful practical experience that you can add to your resume.\n*Federal Community Service Work Study program is only open to US Citizens*\nA representative from each organization will be available to discuss internship and volunteer opportunities with their organization. It is possible to find a position, or at the very least network with organizations you find interesting. Even though all these organizations are in the non-profit/government sectors, they need a wide range of Heinz talent including: project management, marketing, outreach, development, IT and policy analysts.\nPlease note the following reminders and instructions for the event.We will be using Handshake for the virtual fair and it will allow you to browse 1:1 and group meetings with over \u200bnumerous employers. \nHere are some resources to help you get started:   \u25cf How to register for virtual career fair sessions in Handshake  \u25cf Handshake\u2019s Guide to Success at Virtual Career Fairs \n\n\n",
