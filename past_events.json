Call for Code brings start-up, academic, community, and enterprise developers together and inspires them to solve the most pressing societal issues of our time.\n\nThis year\u2019s Call for Code Challenge has been expanded to two tracks in order to tackle two life-altering world problems: COVID-19 and climate change. These issues have the power to compromise our health, our planet and our survival - and need to be addressed now. More information about this year\u2019s challenge can be found on the Challenge homepage: https://callforcode.org/\n\nAdditionally, in partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U), we are launching the inaugural University Edition of the 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge. This will activate student developers, like you, to tackle these world problems. Through a series of virtual hackathons, workshops and other learning opportunities, you will be enabled with the skills necessary to work as a team and create solutions to these issues.\n\nThe 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge - University Edition will kick-off on Earth Day, April 22, with a virtual introduction by IBM\u2019s Chief Developer Advocate and GM Willie Tejada and a special guest speaker to be revealed soon! Following the session, which will include a Q&amp;A, our developer advocates will host workshops to get you started on your projects.\n\nStay tuned in the Slack Workspace (add the #University channel) for information on upcoming virtual hackathons, enablement sessions, office hours and more!\n\nWe will be supporting you every step of the way. From helping you construct a team, to ideation sessions. From roadblocks in your project, to how to present what you\u2019ve created. For any problem you run into, there will be an IBMer excited to work through it with you.\n\nYou are the future, and we hope you will join us by answering the call to make a brighter tomorrow for our planet. There has never been a more important time than right now to use technology for good.\n\n\nHere are some helpful links to get you started!\nApril 22 Event Registration link:\nhttps://cgiu.cgiforms.org/view.php?id=141342\n\nHelpful COVID Code Patterns\nhttps://github.ibm.com/spackows/AI-ContentOps/tree/master/COVID-19\n\nSlack info\nwww.callforcode.org/slack - Please add the #University channel\n\nCOVID Starter Kits:\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Cooperation-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Education-2020\n\nClimate Change Starter Kits:\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Energy-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Disasters-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Water-2020\n\nProject Sample:\nhttps://github.com/Code-and-Response/Project-Sample",

We understand that this is a strange and challenging time for many, so we\u2019d like to invite you to join us as we navigate this new normal for the tech community together. \n\nTo stay connected, create space for folks to collaborate and share some of the things Yelp has been working on, we are launching our very own virtual tech talk series. This series of talks will feature Yelpers from engineering and product and will focus on themes such as career development, technical skills, workplace challenges and Yelp\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nJoin us to hear \"Code Review Etiquette\" by Surashree Kulkarni and \"5 Things We Wish We Knew When We Started Working as SWEs\" by Banafsheh Derayat and Vanessa Gutierrez.",

The office is part think tank, part consulting firm, and part investigative agency, with the mission of providing its sole client\u2014the Secretary of Defense\u2014with timely, insightful, and unbiased analysis to aid strategic decisions. CAPE analysts have impact: our work informs decision makers at the highest levels of the Department and directly affects a $700B budget.\n\nRequirements: Graduate education in quantitative fields; demonstrated analytical ability; a desire to make sense of the strategic picture; curiosity to learn about new topics; and an ability to lead cross-organizational teams.\n\nBenefits: Exposure to the highest levels of the Department; the ability to see direct outcomes from your analysis; a cadre of smart, dedicated colleagues; the opportunity to network across DoD; streamlined hiring and promotion.\n\nNat has experience in other government agencies, think tanks, and research centers. He thinks CAPE is an awesome place to work, but is also happy to answer general questions about government and government-adjacent employment, as well as available fellowship programs.

Typically we would invite you to come to Yelp\u2019s HQ to network, grab a slice of \u2018za, and learn about the technology and culture behind Yelp. With stay-at-home orders across the globe, Yelp (like many of you) has had no choice but to adapt to these changes. We understand that this is a strange and challenging time for many, so we\u2019d like to invite you to join us as we navigate this new normal for the tech community together.\n\nTo stay connected, create space for folks to collaborate and share some of the things Yelp has been working on, we are launching our very own virtual tech talk series. This series of talks will feature Yelpers from engineering and product and will focus on themes such as career development, technical skills, workplace challenges and Yelp\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nEmil Hessel, Product Manager\nTalk: Good Products in Tough Times\n\n2020 has fundamentally transformed the landscape for local businesses and the customers they serve. For many of us, where and how we get food, shop, and even exercise are dramatically different than they were four months ago. With this, the need to stay up-to-date and connected with the businesses in our communities is more universal than ever. One of Yelp's newest products, Yelp Connect, is designed to fill this need. Join us as we talk about how we built an idea into a product used by thousands of businesses to help in their fight for survival. We'll explain what Yelp Connect is, how it's helping businesses and consumers in today's environment, and some key product insights we picked up along the way.",

On average it takes all parties involved approximately 7-14 days to review an EULA and ensure that all unacceptable terms and conditions are identified.\n\nA EULA details the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of software or services. It can also be known as a software license agreement or acceptable use policy. As part of the acquisition process of software or services, GSA reviews the associated EULAs. This review must be completed prior to awarding new contracts or modifying existing contracts. A GSA contracting officer (CO) reviews applicable EULAs for terms and conditions that are not in accordance with Federal law and regulations. The CO may also coordinate a legal review with the Office of General Counsel if they feel it is warranted. Should EULAs contain language that would conflict with Federal law and regulations, the CO must negotiate changes to the EULA to remove the problematic language.\n\nWe are looking for a solution that will use AI and/or ML to improve this manual process. The solution will include a user interface that GSA will use to process the documents and identify unacceptable clauses/terms in the EULAs. Watch our AI / ML challenge video to learn more about the desired solution.\n\nThis solution will decrease the time spent manually reviewing EULAs and free resources to focus on other aspects of the acquisition process. It will also improve the accuracy and consistency of the review process.\n\n\nYoutube video announcing GSA ML/AI Challenge - https://youtu.be/uOBFIqoOJ8k\n\nWebsite with complete details - https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/GSA-artificial-intelligence-AI-machine-learning-ML-challenge/\n\nKey Facts:\n\u00b7      Registration begins: 10 a.m. ET, July 6, 2020\n\u00b7      Submit solutions before: 5 p.m. ET, August 20, 2020\n\u00b7      Semi-finalists announced: 10 a.m. ET, September 4, 2020\n\u00b7      Winner announced: 10 a.m. ET, September 11, 2020\n\u00b7      Each challenge solver (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register by sending an email to challenge2020@gsa.gov with the subject line stating \u2018Challenge 2020 Registration\u2019.\n\n\u00b7      Cash prizes for winning teams:\no  1st place team: $15,000.00\no  2nd place team: $2,500.00\no  3rd place team: $2,500.00\n\n\u00b7      Questions? emailchallenge2020@gsa.gov for more information.",

This series of talks will feature Yelpers from engineering and product and will focus on themes such as career development, technical skills, workplace challenges and Yelp\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nTalk: Creating Meaningful Data Through Rich Contextual Logging Across Microservice\n\nAs engineers, we need data to support our decisions. However, it is a huge step from \u201cwe have data\u201d to \u201cwe have meaningful data\u201d. At Yelp, we use contextual logging to allow data consumers to connect any data sources. In this talk, Kangni will talk about how contextual logging is adopted across Yelp\u2019s microservices via context propagation, and the challenges we encountered.\n\nKangni Wang\nBio: Kangni has been a software engineer on the experimentation team at Yelp for the last 2.5 years. Prior to Yelp, she completed her Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Harvey Mudd College.\n\nTalk: Fuelling Your Career With Coffee Chats\n\nOne of the best ways to meet people and launch your career is to set up short chats over coffee. But, there are no guidelines and it can be daunting to start. We'll go over the individual stages of a coffee chat, from asking someone to transforming it into a mentorship. You\u2019ll pick up tools to have meaningful conversations and walk away with a game plan to get started!\n\nSherry Yuan\nBio: Sherry is an Android engineer at Yelp working on the Yelp for Business Owners Android app. Prior to starting at Yelp, she studied computer science at the University of British Columbia, where she started a coffee chat program with Daphne. She is passionate about Android development, diversity in tech, and creative and technical writing.\n\nDaphne Liu\nBio: Daphne is an Android engineer who enjoys meeting new people and branching out outside her team. She shares her interests in tech, mentorship and diversity by speaking at conferences, writing blogs, and being involved with the Women in CS club she founded at her university. She is currently finishing up her last year of school at the University of British Columbia.",

Typically we would invite you to come to Yelp\u2019s HQ to network, grab a slice of \u2018za, and learn about the technology and culture behind Yelp. With stay-at-home orders across the globe, Yelp (like many of you) has had no choice but to adapt to these changes. We understand that this is a strange and challenging time for many, so we\u2019d like to invite you to join us as we navigate this new normal for the tech community together.\n\nTo stay connected, create space for folks to collaborate and share some of the things Yelp has been working on, we are launching our very own virtual tech talk series. This series of talks will feature Yelpers from engineering and product and will focus on themes such as career development, technical skills, workplace challenges and Yelp\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nTalk: Why you should pursue public speaking and how to get there\n\nStarting a tech career as a minority is challenging. It could mean being the only one to speak against the popular opinion, or becoming more visible to get the same level of recognition.\n\nPublic speaking helps you achieve that and more. This talk shares tips on how to overcome the fear and ways to get started. Attendees will be prepared to brace for presenting from a team meeting to a conference.Yenny Cheung",

On average it takes all parties involved approximately 7-14 days to review an EULA and ensure that all unacceptable terms and conditions are identified.\n\nA EULA details the rights and restrictions which apply to the use of software or services. It can also be known as a software license agreement or acceptable use policy. As part of the acquisition process of software or services, GSA reviews the associated EULAs. This review must be completed prior to awarding new contracts or modifying existing contracts. A GSA contracting officer (CO) reviews applicable EULAs for terms and conditions that are not in accordance with Federal law and regulations. The CO may also coordinate a legal review with the Office of General Counsel if they feel it is warranted. Should EULAs contain language that would conflict with Federal law and regulations, the CO must negotiate changes to the EULA to remove the problematic language.\n\nWe are looking for a solution that will use AI and/or ML to improve this manual process. The solution will include a user interface that GSA will use to process the documents and identify unacceptable clauses/terms in the EULAs. Watch our AI / ML challenge video to learn more about the desired solution.\n\nThis solution will decrease the time spent manually reviewing EULAs and free resources to focus on other aspects of the acquisition process. It will also improve the accuracy and consistency of the review process.\n\n\nYoutube video announcing GSA ML/AI Challenge - https://youtu.be/uOBFIqoOJ8k\n\nWebsite with complete details - https://www.challenge.gov/challenge/GSA-artificial-intelligence-AI-machine-learning-ML-challenge/\n\nKey Facts:\n\u00b7      Registration begins: 10 a.m. ET, July 6, 2020\n\u00b7      Submit solutions before: 5 p.m. ET, August 20, 2020\n\u00b7      Semi-finalists announced: 10 a.m. ET, September 4, 2020\n\u00b7      Winner announced: 10 a.m. ET, September 11, 2020\n\u00b7      Each challenge solver (individual, team, or legal entity) is required to register by sending an email to challenge2020@gsa.gov with the subject line stating \u2018Challenge 2020 Registration\u2019.\n\n\u00b7      Cash prizes for winning teams:\no  1st place team: $15,000.00\no  2nd place team: $2,500.00\no  3rd place team: $2,500.00\n\n\u00b7      Questions? emailchallenge2020@gsa.gov for more information.",
