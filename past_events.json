Call for Code brings start-up, academic, community, and enterprise developers together and inspires them to solve the most pressing societal issues of our time.\n\nThis year\u2019s Call for Code Challenge has been expanded to two tracks in order to tackle two life-altering world problems: COVID-19 and climate change. These issues have the power to compromise our health, our planet and our survival - and need to be addressed now. More information about this year\u2019s challenge can be found on the Challenge homepage: https://callforcode.org/\n\nAdditionally, in partnership with the Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U), we are launching the inaugural University Edition of the 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge. This will activate student developers, like you, to tackle these world problems. Through a series of virtual hackathons, workshops and other learning opportunities, you will be enabled with the skills necessary to work as a team and create solutions to these issues.\n\nThe 2020 Call for Code Global Challenge - University Edition will kick-off on Earth Day, April 22, with a virtual introduction by IBM\u2019s Chief Developer Advocate and GM Willie Tejada and a special guest speaker to be revealed soon! Following the session, which will include a Q&amp;A, our developer advocates will host workshops to get you started on your projects.\n\nStay tuned in the Slack Workspace (add the #University channel) for information on upcoming virtual hackathons, enablement sessions, office hours and more!\n\nWe will be supporting you every step of the way. From helping you construct a team, to ideation sessions. From roadblocks in your project, to how to present what you\u2019ve created. For any problem you run into, there will be an IBMer excited to work through it with you.\n\nYou are the future, and we hope you will join us by answering the call to make a brighter tomorrow for our planet. There has never been a more important time than right now to use technology for good.\n\n\nHere are some helpful links to get you started!\nApril 22 Event Registration link:\nhttps://cgiu.cgiforms.org/view.php?id=141342\n\nHelpful COVID Code Patterns\nhttps://github.ibm.com/spackows/AI-ContentOps/tree/master/COVID-19\n\nSlack info\nwww.callforcode.org/slack - Please add the #University channel\n\nCOVID Starter Kits:\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Cooperation-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Education-2020\n\nClimate Change Starter Kits:\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Energy-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Disasters-2020\nhttps://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Water-2020\n\nProject Sample:\nhttps://github.com/Code-and-Response/Project-Sample",

We understand that this is a strange and challenging time for many, so we\u2019d like to invite you to join us as we navigate this new normal for the tech community together. \n\nTo stay connected, create space for folks to collaborate and share some of the things Yelp has been working on, we are launching our very own virtual tech talk series. This series of talks will feature Yelpers from engineering and product and will focus on themes such as career development, technical skills, workplace challenges and Yelp\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nJoin us to hear \"Code Review Etiquette\" by Surashree Kulkarni and \"5 Things We Wish We Knew When We Started Working as SWEs\" by Banafsheh Derayat and Vanessa Gutierrez.",

The office is part think tank, part consulting firm, and part investigative agency, with the mission of providing its sole client\u2014the Secretary of Defense\u2014with timely, insightful, and unbiased analysis to aid strategic decisions. CAPE analysts have impact: our work informs decision makers at the highest levels of the Department and directly affects a $700B budget.\n\nRequirements: Graduate education in quantitative fields; demonstrated analytical ability; a desire to make sense of the strategic picture; curiosity to learn about new topics; and an ability to lead cross-organizational teams.\n\nBenefits: Exposure to the highest levels of the Department; the ability to see direct outcomes from your analysis; a cadre of smart, dedicated colleagues; the opportunity to network across DoD; streamlined hiring and promotion.\n\nNat has experience in other government agencies, think tanks, and research centers. He thinks CAPE is an awesome place to work, but is also happy to answer general questions about government and government-adjacent employment, as well as available fellowship programs.

Typically we would invite you to come to Yelp\u2019s HQ to network, grab a slice of \u2018za, and learn about the technology and culture behind Yelp. With stay-at-home orders across the globe, Yelp (like many of you) has had no choice but to adapt to these changes. We understand that this is a strange and challenging time for many, so we\u2019d like to invite you to join us as we navigate this new normal for the tech community together.\n\nTo stay connected, create space for folks to collaborate and share some of the things Yelp has been working on, we are launching our very own virtual tech talk series. This series of talks will feature Yelpers from engineering and product and will focus on themes such as career development, technical skills, workplace challenges and Yelp\u2019s response to COVID-19.\n\nEmil Hessel, Product Manager\nTalk: Good Products in Tough Times\n\n2020 has fundamentally transformed the landscape for local businesses and the customers they serve. For many of us, where and how we get food, shop, and even exercise are dramatically different than they were four months ago. With this, the need to stay up-to-date and connected with the businesses in our communities is more universal than ever. One of Yelp's newest products, Yelp Connect, is designed to fill this need. Join us as we talk about how we built an idea into a product used by thousands of businesses to help in their fight for survival. We'll explain what Yelp Connect is, how it's helping businesses and consumers in today's environment, and some key product insights we picked up along the way.",
